# Active-Directory-And-Linux-Security-Lab

## Overview
I’m building a practical lab where I set up Active Directory, integrate Linux systems with it, and secure authentication and services across both platforms. Every step is tested directly in my own environment.

## What’s included
- Virtual lab setup (Windows + Linux)
- Active Directory basics and domain services
- DNS, Kerberos, NTP, SSSD, Winbind
- Joining Linux machines to AD
- Authentication flow between components
- AD-based access control on Linux
- Linux security and hardening
- Auditing and logging
- Firewall and network security
- SELinux configuration
- Service hardening
- Enterprise security practices (CIS, STIG, Zero Trust)

## My goal
I want hands-on understanding of identity, authentication, and security in a mixed Windows–Linux environment instead of just reading theory.

## How to follow
All sections are organized in numbered folders. Open each Markdown file in order and follow along to build the same setup.

## Status
Work in progress. I add and update content after I verify each step in the lab.
